# N4S - Need for Speed ​​Game Clone

N4S is an educational and simplified clone of the famous racing game *Need for Speed*, developed in C. This project aims to simulate a racing experience while serving as an educational support to explore advanced programming concepts in C.

## Features

- **Basic racing simulation**: Control your vehicle, accelerate and brake, with a simple interface.
- **Collision and obstacle management**: The game includes collision detection and obstacles on the track to make the race more immersive.
- **Optimized game loop**: Animations, game logic and interactions are managed in real time for a smooth experience.
- **2D display**: A lightweight graphical interface represents the track and the vehicle's movements.

## Learning Objectives

This project aims to help developers to:

1. Deepen the fundamental concepts of C programming by working on a motivating project.
2. Apply notions of memory management, data structure, and game loop optimization.
3. Discover the basics of simulation and animation for 2D games.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of the C language.
- Familiarity with 2D game programming.
- A C compiler (e.g. GCC) to compile and run the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/estebanbaigts/N4S.git
cd N4S
